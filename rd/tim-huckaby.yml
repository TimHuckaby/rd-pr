  ## Spotlight
  My team amasses terabytes of raw consumer behavior data in Azure SQL for some
  of the largest CPG companies in the world and the list is growing. Recently,
  we ran into a large-scale problem that caused significant worry. Our Stored
  Proc queries to Azure SQL were falling down, running in excess of six hours -
  after that process, we compiled custom reporting in Excel, which took more
  time. You can imagine how displeased our customers were when they wanted to
  see their data in real time. Even more importantly, these customers
  desperately wanted to see the data visualized so they could make strategic,
  product-related decisions.
  
  Cloud architecture is difficult. I have a pretty strong skill set, but Iâ€™m
  savvy enough in my own technical years to know how to lean on the best for
  respected opinions. First, I asked software architects at my own company,
  InterKnowlogy. Then I turned to my fellow RDs Vishwas Lele (from AIS) and
  Edgar Sanchez (from LogicStudio).
  
  Ultimately, we landed on an awesome Azure SQL Data Warehouse solution. PowerBI
  visualizes and reports on the data. We use Azure Data Factory to transform and
  move the data into the Data Warehouse so that PowerBI can do its magic. The
  solution was so beautiful, powerful, awesome, fast, and scalable that it made
  for some very happy customers.
